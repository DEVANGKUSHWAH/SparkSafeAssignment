# SparkSafe - Wildfire Home Hardening Platform

![SparkSafe Logo](public/logo.svg)

SparkSafe is a comprehensive wildfire readiness platform that empowers homeowners to prepare their homes for wildfire season through guided home hardening and a curated marketplace of fire-safe products.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements the **Home Hardening Guide & Marketplace** feature of SparkSafe, providing:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Track progress through step-by-step wildfire hardening upgrades
- **Curated Marketplace**: Browse fire marshal-approved products and bundles
- **Smart Product Recommendations**: Products linked directly to specific hardening tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and resiliency scoring
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design optimized for all devices

## 🎯 Feature Selection & Rationale

### Why I Chose Home Hardening Guide & Marketplace

I selected **Option 1: Home Hardening Guide & Marketplace** over the Wildfire Education Center for several strategic reasons:

#### **1. Higher User Value & Conversion Potential**
- **Action-Oriented**: Directly addresses the user's core need to **take concrete steps** to protect their home
- **Revenue Generation**: Marketplace integration creates a clear path to monetization through product sales and partnerships
- **Immediate Impact**: Users can see tangible progress through completion tracking and resiliency scoring

#### **2. More Complex Technical Challenge**
- **State Management**: Requires sophisticated state management across multiple components (tasks, cart, progress tracking)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implementing live progress updates when tasks are completed demonstrates advanced React patterns
- **E-commerce Functionality**: Shopping cart, product filtering, and checkout flow showcase full-stack thinking
- **Context API Integration**: Multiple context providers (TaskContext, CartContext) show scalable architecture

#### **3. Better Product-Market Fit**
- **Addresses Decision Paralysis**: Homeowners often know they should prepare but don't know where to start or what to buy
- **Expert Curation**: Fire marshal-approved products build trust and reduce research burden
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Task-specific product suggestions create a guided, consultative experience
- **Progress Gamification**: Visual progress indicators and resiliency scores motivate continued engagement

#### **4. Comprehensive User Experience**
- **Full User Journey**: From assessment → planning → shopping → implementation
- **Multiple Touchpoints**: Dashboard, detailed task views, marketplace, and checkout create engagement depth
- **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Bundle deals and related product recommendations increase average order value
- **Long-Term Engagement**: Ongoing task completion and seasonal reminders drive repeat visits

#### **5. Scalability & Business Logic**
- **Partnership Ecosystem**: Can integrate with contractors, insurance companies, and product manufacturers
- **Data Collection**: User behavior on tasks and purchases provides valuable insights for product development
- **Seasonal Relevance**: Can adapt recommendations based on fire season timing and regional risk levels
- **Insurance Integration**: Completed tasks can directly feed into insurance discount applications

The marketplace approach transforms SparkSafe from an informational platform into an **actionable solution** that guides users from uncertainty to protection while creating sustainable business value.
